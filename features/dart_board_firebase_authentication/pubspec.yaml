  # To add Flutter specific assets to your application, add an assets section,
  # like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add Flutter specific custom fonts to your application, add a fonts
  # section here, in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should
  # have a "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages


  # This section identifies your Flutter project as a module meant for
  # embedding in a native host app.  These identifiers should _not_ ordinarily
  # be changed after generation - they are used to ensure that the tooling can
  # maintain consistency when adding or modifying assets and plugins.
  # They also do not have any bearing on your native host application's
  # identifiers, which may be completely independent or the same as these.
